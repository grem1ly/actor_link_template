# Actor Link Template

**Note:** This template is specifically designed for mobile devices. Edits are still underway.

## Objective

  We all have fun little games we play to pass the time if we have say 15 minutes to kill. Some play I Spy, 20 Questions, or the Alphabet Game. I, for one, like to play what I call Link (or Connect) the Actors. This might already be an established game, but the following explanation serves as instructions for how I play it. The objective is to take two random actors and identify either a movie they both star in, or continue to link more actors to complete the connection with a movie. A simple example would be if you were given Matt Damon and George Clooney. You can link them together immediately as they both star in Ocean's Eleven. A more complicated example would be if you were given Idris Elba and Sigourney Weaver. For this, you might connect Idris Elba to Anthony Mackie in Avengers: Age of Ultron, then Anthony Mackie to Sam Worthington in Man on a Ledge, and finally, Sam Worthington to Sigourney Weaver in Avatar.

  So, if you need to connect more actors, you have to also link them with a movie each time. I think that the more complicated the connection, the more fun the game is. The caveat to this, however, is that once more and more connections are added, it's difficult to remember all of them. Therefore, I have created a template so you don't have to remember.  

## How to Play

  * **Step 1:** Click "Play" to being. You will be prompted with two random actor names ([list](docs/data/actor_names.csv)). Feel free to shuffle them individually by clicking the "Reshuffle" button below each name, or refresh the page to start over and be prompted with two new names.

  * **Step 2:** If you can connect the actors immediately with a common movie, click the "Name The Linking Movie" button and fill out the prompt. To exit or "go back," click the "x" or the surrounding grey area. Once the prompt is completed and the "<span>&#10003;</span>" button is clicked, the connection is presented and the "game" is over. Refresh the page to play again.

  * **Step 3:** If more actors are needed to complete the connection, click the "Connect More Actors" button.

  * **Step 4:** Once the previous step is completed, you will be prompted with a choice to either link a new actor with the preselected actor on the left or to link a new actor with the preselected actor on the right. In the complex example above, I would click on the "Add Link" button under Idris Elba's name since I made the first connection with him. Fill out the prompt with the linking actor as well as the movie in which they both star and then click the "<span>&#10003;</span>" button to continue.

  * **Step 5:** Repeat Steps 2 - 4.

  **Note:** All added connections can be edited after the fact. This means that if for some reason, I wanted to connect Idris Elba to Charlize Theron in Prometheus instead of Anthony Mackie in Avengers: Age of Ultron, I can select the box with Anthony Mackie's name, and change it to Charlize Theron just as with the box with the connecting movie. The preselected actors cannot be altered in this way.
